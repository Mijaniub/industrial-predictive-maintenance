# industrial-predictive-maintenance
Deep learning-based binary classification model for predicting machine failures in industrial manufacturing systems. Uses the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset to detect rare failure events from operational sensor data.

## Project Overview
This project develops a deep learning-based binary classification model to predict machine failures using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset.

## File Structure
- `report/` – Final project report (PDF)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/` – Source code for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `data/` – Dataset (or instructions to download)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks in order or execute scripts in `src/`.

## Results
The final model achieved a recall of 0.71 and PR-AUC of 0.68 on the test set.
